There are a lot of components to this encounter and there are a lot of
mechanics at play, but I thought I would challenge myself. If any of the
mechanics are confusing, you need me to explain more, or you think it is too
complicated and I should reduce the scope, please let me know and I'm happy
to adjust it.

The scope ended up ballooning and this became very complicated very fast. I
think there might be a few bugs I couldn't catch, but it is consistently
playable all the way through. I placed my emphasis on the programming
implementation rather than effects replication.
